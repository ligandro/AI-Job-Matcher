Then join our team and develop innovative solutions with us!\n\nWhat makes this job so special?\n\nYou will support our team in implementing robust and scalable data pipelines that combine data from a variety of sources (e.g. APIs, databases, streaming platforms).\nWith your work, you will not only support us with valuable projects and the efficient automation of data flows, but you can also contribute your creative ideas to the optimization of interfaces and cloud architecture.\nTogether with our team, you will work on optimizing our data infrastructure in the cloud (e.g. Kubernetes clusters), automate deployments, and create reliable monitoring and alerting solutions.\nSince the quality and availability of data is important to us, we would appreciate your support in setting up monitoring tools (e.g. Prometheus, Grafana) to keep the data up-to-date and correct.\nWe're there for each other and value each other. We work as a team and offer you the flexibility to combine your working hours with your studies.\nWhy are you the right fit for this job?\n\nInitial experience with cloud technologies, Linux, containers (e.g. Docker) or modern databases (e.g. ClickHouse) is a plus, but not a requirement – \u200b\u200bwe will support you in your onboarding.\nYou have a strong interest in modern data pipelines and platforms based on Kubernetes, and your curiosity to take on new tasks and familiarize yourself with topics such as monitoring and scalability makes you particularly valuable to our team.\nIf we could possibly wish for it, you already have knowledge of REST APIs, data modeling, or programming languages \u200b\u200b(e.g., Python, Rust, Go) – but this is not required. What's much more important to us is your motivation to get involved in a variety of topics.\nBasic knowledge of data processing, integration, visualization, and management, as well as extract, transform, and load (ETL) pipelines, would be advantageous but not required. Furthermore, you are ideally already familiar with configuration and orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow, Dagster, Luigi).\nAre you enrolled in a degree program in computer science, data engineering, business informatics, or a similar field?
